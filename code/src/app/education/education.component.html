                    <p><b><mark>Housing</mark></b><br>

                        <b><i><mark>1. Housing (25-35 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Anything you pay toward keeping a roof over your head is considered a housing expense,
                        including
                        rent or mortgage payments, property taxes, HOA dues, and home maintenance costs. For
                        most
                        budgeters, this category is by far the biggest.<br>

                        <br><b><i><mark>Expenses</mark></i></b><br>
                        <b><i><mark>2. Transportation (10-15 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Regardless of location and lifestyle, everyone needs to get from point A to point B.
                        This is why
                        transportation is considered an essential cost. Typically, this category includes car
                        payments,
                        registration and DMV fees, gas, maintenance, parking, tolls, and public transit.<br>
                        <b><i><mark>3. Food (10-15 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Groceries, of course, are an essential expense for every family. Many budgeters also
                        include dining
                        out in this category (e.g., restaurant meals, work lunches, food delivery, etc.)
                        However, if you’re
                        someone who tends to spend a significant amount of money on things like gourmet food and
                        wine,
                        you may want to put your non-grocery food expenses into one of the non-essential
                        categories.<br>
                        <b><i><mark>4. Utilities (5-10 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Water, electricity, and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) are vital to
                        practically every
                        well-functioning household. Your utilities category should include all the expenses that
                        keep these
                        services up and running, including your gas, electricity, and water and sewage bills.
                        For most families,
                        it should also include cell phone, cable, and internet expenses.<br>
                        <b><i><mark>5. Insurance (10-25 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        This is one category that depends very much on your budgeting preferences. Many
                        budgeters prefer
                        to categorize things like health insurance under “Healthcare” or auto insurance under
                        “Transportation”—a completely valid option. If you choose to follow our guidelines for
                        this category, it
                        should include health insurance, homeowner’s or renter’s insurance, home warranties or
                        protection
                        plans, auto insurance, life insurance, and disability insurance.<br>
                        <b><i><mark>6. Medical & Healthcare (5-10 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Few would argue that maintaining your health and well-being is essential. This category
                        includes
                        whatever you spend on healthcare that does not include insurance premiums, such as your
                        out-ofpocket costs for primary care, specialty care (dermatologists, psychologists,
                        etc.), dental care, urgent
                        care, prescriptions, and medical devices.

                        <br><b><i><mark>Investments/debts</mark></i></b><br>
                        <b><i><mark>7. Saving, Investing, & Debt Payments (10-20 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        Ironically, this often-overlooked (or underfunded) category is arguably the most
                        important. Although
                        saving money doesn’t have much impact on your day-to-day existence, it has everything to
                        do with
                        you and your family’s financial health further down the road. In the world of budgeting,
                        it’s called
                        “paying yourself first.”

                        <br><b><i><mark>Discretionary</mark></i></b><br>
                        <b><i><mark>8. Personal Spending (5-10 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        This category is really a catchall that can include anything commonly considered a
                        personal care or
                        “lifestyle” expense. Personal spending can include gym memberships, grooming products,
                        new
                        clothes and shoes, home decor and furnishings, gifts, magazine subscriptions, personal
                        hygiene
                        supplies, dry cleaning expenses—even basic household items like laundry detergent are
                        often
                        categorized as a personal expense.<br>
                        <b><i><mark>9. Recreation & Entertainment (5-10 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        This is the one category in your budget that really constitutes “fun money.” That’s not
                        to say it’s not an
                        important one, though. For most of us, carving out leisure time (and money) is essential
                        if you want to
                        maintain a healthy work-life balance. This category can include concert tickets,
                        sporting events, game
                        nights (e.g. a night out bowling), vacations, movies, streaming service subscriptions
                        (e.g., Hulu and
                        Netflix), kids’ activities, restaurants (if you didn’t include this expense under
                        “Food”), video games,
                        hobbies, really anything that constitutes fun and entertainment for your family. Enjoy
                        this money
                        however you wish—you’ve earned it!<br>
                        <b><i><mark>10. Miscellaneous (5-10 percent)</mark></i></b><br>
                        This category is reserved for anything you may not have already budgeted for or
                        categorized.
                        Unsurprisingly, it’s highly personalized and varies greatly from family to family. For
                        example, if you
                        have a larger family, it’s likely you spend a fair amount on clothes and haircuts for
                        your kids. If you’ve
                        maxed out your “Personal Expenses” category, you could account for those items here. Or,
                        perhaps
                        you’ve recently returned to school to get a degree that will ultimately lead to a higher
                        income. In such
                        a case, your tuition and textbook expenses could fall into this category.
